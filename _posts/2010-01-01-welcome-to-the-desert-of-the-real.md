This code review is for my CS-499 final project. We were tasked on creating a in debth code review, going over previous projects. We had to pick previous projects to make enhancement too. The goal of this is to make enhancments to show mastery of the following five course outcomes.

 [CS-499-01] Employ strategies for building collaborative environments that enable diverse audiences to support organizational decision
making in the field of computer science
 [CS-499-02] Design, develop, and deliver professional-quality oral, written, and visual communications that are coherent, technically sound,
and appropriately adapted to specific audiences and contexts
 [CS-499-03] Design and evaluate computing solutions that solve a given problem using algorithmic principles and computer science practices and
standards appropriate to its solution, while managing the trade-offs involved in design choices (data structures and algorithms)
 [CS-499-04] Demonstrate an ability to use well-founded and innovative techniques, skills, and tools in computing practices for the purpose of
implementing computer solutions that deliver value and accomplish industry-specific goals (software engineering/design/database)
 [CS-499-05] Develop a security mindset that anticipates adversarial exploits in software architecture and designs to expose potential vulnerabilities,
mitigate design flaws, and ensure privacy and enhanced security of data and resources
