This code review is for my CS-499 final project. This review is going over three programing artifacts I have previously created. The end goal of this is to make enhancments to these projects to show mastery of the following five course outcomes.

 [CS-499-01] Employ strategies for building collaborative environments that enable diverse audiences to support organizational decision
making in the field of computer science

 [CS-499-02] Design, develop, and deliver professional-quality oral, written, and visual communications that are coherent, technically sound,
and appropriately adapted to specific audiences and contexts

 [CS-499-03] Design and evaluate computing solutions that solve a given problem using algorithmic principles and computer science practices and
standards appropriate to its solution, while managing the trade-offs involved in design choices (data structures and algorithms)

 [CS-499-04] Demonstrate an ability to use well-founded and innovative techniques, skills, and tools in computing practices for the purpose of
implementing computer solutions that deliver value and accomplish industry-specific goals (software engineering/design/database)

 [CS-499-05] Develop a security mindset that anticipates adversarial exploits in software architecture and designs to expose potential vulnerabilities,
mitigate design flaws, and ensure privacy and enhanced security of data and resources

I am enhancing three different artifacts meet these course outcomes. The first one is my final from CS-330. In this artifact I use c++ and opengl to create a 3D scene along with camera movments. The next artifact is from my final in CS-320. I created mobile appointment software using Java along with automated tests. My last artifact is my final from the CS-340 class. In this artifact, I accessed a database and implimented a update, delete, create and read function to the database. This is accessed via a web portal that I created.
