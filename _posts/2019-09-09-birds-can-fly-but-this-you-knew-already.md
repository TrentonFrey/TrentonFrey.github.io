### Professional self-assessment


  My experience in the computer science program has felt like a long, stressful, journey with many challenges that I had to overcome.  I began the journey at a university near my home and attended classes in person.  I invested a year and a half at this university only to realize that it was going to be impossible to work a full time job and attend in person classes.  It was at this time that I decided to switch to online classes to obtain my degree.  This led me to Southern New Hampshire University.  This change afforded me the amazing opportunity to pursue my degree in computer science while becoming a network operations specialist.

  Looking back over my experience, I have to say that my biggest struggle throughout the program had to be stress management.  At first I found it incredibly difficult working full time and taking classes.  Although my job was in my field, I still needed to come home and switch gears to my studies and class work to continue working towards my degree.   As time progressed, I learned how to manage my time much more efficiently and this decreased the amount of stress that I was feeling.  For most people, stress may not be that big of a deal but for me, the stress was affecting my productivity.
  
  My past experiences had prepared me fairly well for handling the workload of developing this ePortfolio while working full time.  This has been the largest most in depth project that I have ever done.  Had I not learned stress management skills through my experiences, I would not have made it through this.  Fortunately for me, I am now very used to this level of stress and proper time management is key.
  
  While I worked through this program, I had a few different classes where teamwork was key.  Working as part of a team was a big change for me, however, I was able to work well in a team environment on a full sized project.  Being able to review my peersâ€™ code within bitbucket to provide meaningful and constructive feedback was very important.  The course CS-310 was fantastic for creating a collaborative environment to give a real world experience.  This course really taught me the correct way to collaborate in a large team environment.  I was able to work as a scrum master in an agile environment throughout the program as well as in the CS-250.  I was able to develop strong leadership skills while paying the highest regard to all parties involved which allowed me to communicate the development progress to the stakeholders.  This gave me a clear understanding of the correct terminology to use with stakeholders and explain the progression of this project.

  Throughout my time in the computer science program, I have been able to really hone my development skills untilzing data structures and algorithms, software engineering and databases. Each course required utilizing specific skills. After each course, these skills become more honed and polished for a professional environment. For example, we really started honing these skills in CS-260. This was a big introduction to higher level algorithms and data structures. Comparing that simple class to CS-330 where we built a over nine hundred line program creating a three dimensional scene utilizing openGL you can really see just how developed these skills have become.  
  
  Throughout my ePortfolio, I included three of my previous final projects. I included my final from CS-320, CS-330 and CS-340. I decided to use these artifacts for various reasons. To showcase my skills in Software Design and Engineering, I used my project from CS-330. This is my three dimensional scene utilizing openGL. I included this because it was the most challenging project I have ever done and I was unhappy with it when I originally had finished it. My dissatisfaction with this artifact gave me a clear path to enhance.
  
  The next showcase of my skills is in the algorithms and data structure area. I decided to use my project from CS-320. This project is a mobile appointment software with automated testing to test current features. I wanted to use this project for the realism factor. This was one of the most realistic projects I have had to develop. The creation of the automated testing showcases my skills perfectly for this area.
  
  The final showcase of my skills is in the database area. For this I am using my final project from CS-340. This project is my first experience with full stack development. We created a mongodb utilizing data provided from an animal shelter. We then built a web portal for user access to this database. I included this because I was unhappy with my original submission in CS-340. This gave me a clear path to enhance. The implementation of the database is also perfect to showcase my skills in this area. 
  
  I reached the following five course outcomes with the enhancements I made on the three artifacts. I employed strategies for building collaborative environments that enable diverse audiences to support organizational decision-making in the field of computer science by completing the following enhancements. Throughout all three artifacts I reworked all commenting standards. This had to be done to ensure future developers working on this code are able to easily read and understand the code.
I designed, developed, and delivered professional-quality oral, written, and visual communications that are coherent, technically sound, and appropriately adapted to specific audiences and contexts by completing the following enhancements.Artifact two and three, the animal shelter database and the mobile appointment software required a readme file showcasing features, changes and known bugs. With the big changes I made to each I had to update the readme files to reflect the new features. 
		
  I designed and evaluated computing solutions that solve a given problem using algorithmic principles and computer science practices and standards appropriate to its solution, while managing the trade-offs involved in design choices by completing the following enhancements. This was reached with my enhancements to my 3D scene and the mobile appointment software. I added multi texture support to my 3D scene along with the ability to load objects using outside files rather than building the object in line. These solutions resolved the problem of only having one texture along with making the main code much more efficient. The problem with the mobile appointment software was slow database functions for creating, reading, updating and deleting. This was fixed by rebuilding the backend functionality to the database to hold user queue data speeding up the process for the user.
	
  I demonstrated an ability to use well-founded and innovative techniques, skills, and tools in computing practices for the purpose of implementing computer solutions that deliver value and accomplish industry-specific goals by completing the following enhancements. These enhancements were done to my mobile appointment software. I added a full workflow feature, allowing the user to add work tasks. I then created automated testing to ensure these features operate as intended.
  
  I developed a security mindset that anticipates adversarial exploits in software architecture and designs to expose potential vulnerabilities, mitigate design flaws, and ensure privacy and enhanced security of data and resources by completing the following enhancements. I added a secure login to the webportal on my animal shelter web portal. This projects the clients data by ensuring only trusted users can view. I also added backend support to store the login information. Username and password to be exact.
