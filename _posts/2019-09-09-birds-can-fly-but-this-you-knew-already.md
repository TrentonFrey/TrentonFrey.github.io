### Professional self-assessment


  My experience in the computer science program has felt like a long, stressful, journey with many challenges that I had to overcome.  I began the journey at a university near my home and attended classes in person.  I invested a year and a half at this university only to realize that it was going to be impossible to work a full time job and attend in person classes.  It was at this time that I decided to switch to online classes to obtain my degree.  This led me to Southern New Hampshire University.  This change afforded me the amazing opportunity to pursue my degree in computer science while becoming a network operations specialist.

  Looking back over my experience, I have to say that my biggest struggle throughout the program had to be stress management.  At first I found it incredibly difficult working full time and taking classes.  Although my job was in my field, I still needed to come home and switch gears to my studies and class work to continue working towards my degree.   As time progressed, I learned how to manage my time much more efficiently and this decreased the amount of stress that I was feeling.  For most people, stress may not be that big of a deal but for me, the stress was affecting my productivity.
  
  My past experiences had prepared me fairly well for handling the workload of developing this ePortfolio while working full time.  This has been the largest most in depth project that I have ever done.  Had I not learned stress management skills through my experiences, I would not have made it through this.  Fortunately for me, I am now very used to this level of stress and proper time management is key.
  
  While I worked through this program, I had a few different classes where teamwork was key.  Working as part of a team was a big change for me, however, I was able to work well in a team environment on a full sized project.  Being able to review my peersâ€™ code within bitbucket to provide meaningful and constructive feedback was very important.  The course CS-310 was fantastic for creating a collaborative environment to give a real world experience.  This course really taught me the correct way to collaborate in a large team environment.  I was able to work as a scrum master in an agile environment throughout the program as well as in the CS-250.  I was able to develop strong leadership skills while paying the highest regard to all parties involved which allowed me to communicate the development progress to the stakeholders.  This gave me a clear understanding of the correct terminology to use with stakeholders and explain the progression of this project.

  Throughout my time in the computer science program, I have been able to really hone my development skills untilzing data structures and algorithms, software engineering and databases. Each course required utilizing specific skills. After each course, these skills become more honed and polished for a professional environment. For example, we really started honing these skills in CS-260. This was a big introduction to higher level algorithms and data structures. Comparing that simple class to CS-330 where we built a over nine hundred line program creating a three dimensional scene utilizing openGL you can really see just how developed these skills have become.  
  
  Throughout my ePortfolio, I included three of my previous final projects. I included my final from CS-320, CS-330 and CS-340. I decided to use these artifacts for various reasons. To showcase my skills in Software Design and Engineering, I used my project from CS-330. This is my three dimensional scene utilizing openGL. I included this because it was the most challenging project I have ever done and I was unhappy with it when I originally had finished it. My dissatisfaction with this artifact gave me a clear path to enhance.
  
  The next showcase of my skills is in the algorithms and data structure area. I decided to use my project from CS-320. This project is a mobile appointment software with automated testing to test current features. I wanted to use this project for the realism factor. This was one of the most realistic projects I have had to develop. The creation of the automated testing showcases my skills perfectly for this area.
  
  The final showcase of my skills is in the database area. For this I am using my final project from CS-340. This project is my first experience with full stack development. We created a mongodb utilizing data provided from an animal shelter. We then built a web portal for user access to this database. I included this because I was unhappy with my original submission in CS-340. This gave me a clear path to enhance. The implementation of the database is also perfect to showcase my skills in this area.
