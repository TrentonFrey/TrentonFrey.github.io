### Professional self-assessment


	My experience in the computer science program has been long and full of challenges I had to overcome at every corner. Starting at a different university I invested a year and a half into pursuing my degree where it became clear it would be impossible to work a full time job and attend my classes.  It was at this time I decided to switch universities and pressure my degree at southern new hampshire university. This change was an amazing opportunity for me, I was able to pursue a big step in my career by becoming a network operations specialist, all the while working towards my computer science degree.
  
	Looking back over my experience I have to say my biggest struggle throughout the program had to be stress management. At first I found it incredibly difficult working a full time job in my field trying to learn the ropes just to come home to switch gears and work on my computer science program work. This became much easier as time progressed and I learned how to manage my time much more effectively this decreased the amount of stress on me as well. For most people stress may not be that big of a deal, but for me when I was unable to control stress loads I found productivity completely dropped to nothing , being able to control this increased my productivity while working an immeasurable amount. 
  
	The past experiences had prepared me fairly well for the workload of developing this ePortfolio. This has been the biggest most in depth project I have ever done, without my learning experiences dealing with stress management I surely would not have made it through this. Fortunately for me I am very used to this type of stress and being able to properly manage time is key to that. 
  
	While I worked though this program I had a few different classes where teamwork was a key part. This was a big change for me but I was able to learn how to properly work with a team on a full sized project. Being able to review peers' code while time within bitbucket to provide meaningful and constructive feedback was a key component of that. The course CS-310 did a fantastic job at creating a collaborative environment to give real world experience. This course really taught me the correct way to collaborate in a big team environment. I was able to work as a scrum master in an agile environment  throughout this program as well in CS-250. This experience gave me fantastic leadership skills alongside being able to take all parties involved into consideration. This allowed me to communicate the development progress to the stakeholders. This gave me a clear understanding on the correct terminology to use with stakeholders to explain the progression of the project. 
  
	Throughout my time in the computer science program I have been able to really hone my development skills, this includes experience with data structures and algorithms, software engineering and databases. Each course required utilizing specific skills after each course these skills become more honed and polished for a professional environment. For example we really started honing these skills in CS-260. This was a big introduction to higher level algorithms and data structures. Comparing that simple class to CS-330 where we built a over nine hundred line program creating a three dimensional scene utilizing openGL you can really see just how developed these skills have become.  
  
	Throughout my ePortfolio I included three of my preivorse final projects. These include my final from CS-320, CS-330 and CS-340. I decided to use these artifacts for various reasons. To showcase my skills in Software Design and Engineering I used my project from CS-330. This is my three dimensional scene utilizing openGL. I included this because this was the most challenging project I have ever done, and I was unhappy with it when I originally finished it. This gave me a clear path to enhance.
  
	The next showcase of my skills is in the algorithms and data Structure area. I decided to use my project from CS-320. This project is a mobile appointment software with automated testing to test current features. I wanted to use this project for the realism factor. This was one of the most realistic projects I have had to develop. The creation of the automated testing showcases my skills perfectly for this area.
  
	The final showcase of my skills is in the database area. For this I am using my final project from CS-340. This project is my first experience with full stack development. We created a mongodb utilizing data provided from an animal shelter. We then built a web portal for user access to this database. I included this since I was unhappy with my original submission in CS-340. This gave me a clear path to enhance. The implementation of the database is also perfect to showcase my skills in this area.
